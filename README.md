# Huffman Coding Project

This is a Java implementation of the **Huffman Coding algorithm** â€” a popular lossless data compression technique.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Encode any input string using Huffman coding
- Build Huffman Tree based on character frequency
- Generate Huffman codes for characters
- Decode Huffman-encoded strings
- Simple console-based user interface

  ## ðŸ§  How Huffman Coding Works

1. Calculate frequency of each character.
2. Build a binary tree with the least frequent characters at the bottom.
3. Assign binary codes â€” left is `0`, right is `1`.
4. Encode input using the generated codes.
